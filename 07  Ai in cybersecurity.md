# Artifical Intelligence (AI) in Cybersecurity
## Core Concepts

### Role of AI/ML in Cybersecurity
- Machine Learning for intrusion detection and malware anlays
- Predictive analaytics for attack preventation
- AI- driven SOC automation (SOAR tools)

  ## AI Techniques in Security
  - Supervised learnning: Malware classification (Beingn vs Malicious)
  - Unsupervised learning: Anomly detection in logs
  - REinforcement learning: Adative response system
 
    ## Applications of AiI in Threat detection
    
  - Email phishing detection using NLP
  - Behavior-based enddpoint protection
  - Network traffic anomaly detection (IDS/IPS enhancement)
  - User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA)

  ## AI-Powered Tools & Platforms

- IBM QRadar Advisor with Watson
- Darktrace (AI for network anomaly detection)
- CrowdStrike Falcon (AI endpoint protection)
- CylancePROTECT, Azure Sentinel (ML-based alerts)

  ### Limitations & Ethical Challenges
- Adversarial ML (poisoning data, evasion attacks)
- Privacy concerns (training data exposure)
- Explainability issues (AI decision transparency)
